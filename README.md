My Journey on python
I have been learning Python and I just wanted to share my journey on all the projects I did and and doing A friend of mind just suggested that I should out everything I do on Github, so you will find projects varying from beginners where I just have "Hello World" printed to advanced projects. I am loving my python Journey so far Happy Learning !
